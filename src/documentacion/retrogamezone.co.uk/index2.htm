              <P><B>So, it's time I close up shop. It's been more than 2 years since I last updated RGZ - but I love the
              girl too much to simply let her die and be forgotten, vanishing from the internet all together. Thanks to
              some very kind people over at The VG Resource the site will stay online for people to enjoy but mostly -
              just as a reminder to myself of all the great times I've had doing this. This site has been a huge part of
              my life and I've met some great people because of it. <A HREF="http://www.spriters-resource.com/" target="_self">Dazz</A>,
              the late <A HREF="http://tsgk.captainn.net/" target="_self">N-Finity</A>, WaxPoetic, all the truly amazing people at the
              Captain N Forums back in the day (Stewie_for_gov, Nessa Mouse, Flash [I think... the blue and yellow MegaMan
              guy]) - so many names have escaped me but I hope you are all doing well. Seriously the fun I had on those
              forums still makes me smile and I miss those days greatly. But most of all it's <A
              HREF="http://www.nes-snes-sprites.com/" target="_self">Locke_gb7</A> who I am most thankful for meeting. Having shared
              countless good times and pretty much being like a brother during the heyday of the site - he has become a
              truly good friend.</B></P>
              <P><B>The first sprite site I ever heavily used was The Shyguy Kingdom. It was huge, organised and
              everything looked perfect. Now, tSR (The Spriter's Resource) is easily the better site. But back in the
              day with there organised by &quot;company&quot; oddness, giant &quot;credit tags&quot; on the sprite
              sheets and just general attitude of quantity over quality, TSGK was king. I was just a kid using the
              sprites to make games in The Games Factory and TSGK seemed to have everything. That is, of course, until I
              wanted to make a Wacky Races game using the sprites from the NES game. TSGK didn't have those, tSR didn't
              and a small site I stumbled across called NES-SNES-Sprites didn't either, hell they didn't even have
              complete sheets, just the odd frame/sprite of things. The whole internet didn't have them. So it was with
              that which led me to capture my first sprites. Sprites from a game the rest of the world didn't seem to
              care about. Afterwards I submitted them to TSGK and NES-SNES-Sprites. They were accepted - and seeing my
              work on the internet made me feel a huge sense of pride - I was hooked.</B></P>
              <P><B>Me and Locke_gb7 from NES-SNES-Sprites started to talk, talk a lot. He changed from doing odd
              sprites and doing full complete sheets. We partnered up, worked together, challenged each other.
              RetroGameZone, if I recall correctly went online 1st January 2003. That's 12 years ago - I was 13/14 at
              the time and was full of excitement. We were like 2 best friends on an adventure. After I learnt that some
              MegaMan sprites I accepted from a submission were lifted from Sprites Inc I was devastated, not only had
              stolen work been displayed on my site but now I felt I was missing content. And then Locke_gb7 steps in -
              like a madman he replaces all the stolen sprites with his own, working hours to capture them all. He even
              found sprites that Sprites Inc (which specialises in MegaMan sprites) themselves didn't have. I was
              amazed. Me and Locke_gb7 was pushing content out like something obsessed.&nbsp;</B></P>
              <P><B>Having N-Finity accept my work made me feel fantastic. I saw the man as a mentor and his approval
              meant the world. I became an active member at the forums there (The Captain N Forums - as TSGK was part of
              the Captain N Network) having a fantastic time. I loved the people there, it was amazing - a true
              community. It felt like I was hanging with my best friends just talking crap about videogames and making
              sprite comics (which were all the rage back then).&nbsp; I had also become an active member at the tSR
              forums submitting some work there and generally having a good time. And then everything changed. N-Finity
              passed away...</B></P>

              <P><B><I>pchan koko. It pains me to be the bearer of bad news to all those who have yet to hear. But last
              week Webster, creator of CaptainN.net and my dearly beloved, passed away suddenly. He was only 22, but he
              touched our lives so deeply.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>I can't begin to describe my pain and sadness, but that's not to say that of others is any less.
              So many people were touched by his life and his way. So many lives were changed by him. It's most
              traumatic of all that it is so suddenly that he is taken from us, at least from this physical plane. But
              he will always be with us. He's just a thought away, a short distance indeed. He's always with us.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>If any of you would like to give your condolences, there is a forum thread that you can post to,
              or you can come into our IRC channel. Just click the IRC button on the site's navigation to the left and
              navigate to us. You can use an IRC client or our java client. We'd be happy to receive you. Last but not
              least, if you have a personal tribute that you would like to present for us to post on this site, in a
              tribute coming soon, please mail with it. You can alternatively present it on the forum, as we will
              provide a link to the thread during the tribute. We are trying to assemble a suitable tribute at a place
              that was and is and always will be home to the one I call webbychan.</I></B></P>

              <B>Reading it now still breaks my heart, and makes me feel a bit sick with grief. I was devastated. The
              community was devastated. TSGK fell silent. As a community we tried to stand strong, to endure, to carry
              on the flame, but as weeks turned to months, and months to years the lack of new members started to take
              it's toll. The community was dying. I really didn't want TSGK to die. I knew I could never fill N-Finity's
              shoes but I wanted to keep the show on the road, to not let him down. I started talking heavily with
              WaxPoetic, time zones made it tough and we constantly ran into problems. The program used to organise the
              sprite sheets wouldn't work, at all, for me. But it didn't matter, I would do it manually, or at least be
              able to update the site with sheets that had already been processed. On 28th February 2009 I was a staff
              member at TSGK. I was so honoured and posted my first test update. Things didn't go well. Not only
              couldn't I get my avatar to work during the update but me being added to the system seemed to cause havoc.
              The things is, no one really knew how the site worked. We tried, and we tried. But me and Wax knew that as
              much as we loved N-Finity and TSGK, we weren't going to get anywhere. After much talking we came to our
              decision, tSR would be the home of TSGK's content - so that it may be seen, used and enjoyed by as many
              people as possible.</B>

              <B><I>News, news, news.</I></B>
              <P><B><I>posted on Tuesday, March 31, 2009 by WaxPoetic</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>For those of you wondering about the sudden movement and then the sudden lack of movement,
              explanations are in order. Explanations that are, perhaps, site altering.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>For the last two years we've been struggling to keep things moving around here. Every time we
              just about recover, something goes wrong. Like Goemar joining which somehow caused site-wide interior
              glitches (through no fault of his own) even though it shouldn't have been a problem.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>As a testament to Web's coding skills - I asked a friend of mine who, like Web, has been coding
              since she first found the internet - and she said that much of the code shouldn't function at all. Bizarre
              little tricks and coding done in ways that are considered not to be done due to the dangers inherent. What
              she was saying was, Web was a freaking genius. (We all knew this to be true.)</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>After much talking between this sites' admin and a certain others, new plans have unfolded.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>TSGK is not 'closing,' it is changing. This front page will (in time) be replaced with a new
              site, a new TSGK which will serve as the new front page home of the N-Fans and the comics portal which
              once existed on Captainn.net.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>The content will remain here as a sort of open-source testament to what Web could do, it will
              simply not be the first thing you see.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>As for new content? We're in the process of (very) slowly sending over everything to our
              long-standing friends (even if the members didn't know it) at TSR.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>So, without further adieu, http://spriters-resource.com/ shall be the new home of TSGK content
              and updates.</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>Perhaps someday we'll be able to reinvent the TSGK sprite site again with a new toolset and a new
              Captain to pilot this vessel. In the meantime, we're going to hand the reigns to someone more capable
              (Dazz over at TSR) and turn this site into something Web would still be proud of!</I></B></P>
              <P><B><I>As I said, TSGK's sprite website will remain as a moment to Web. (But please stop submitting
              stuff!)</I></B>

              <B>However, like an idiot, I (who was an active member on tSR's forum by this point) decided to post it
              the day after, on 1st April aka - April Fools Day. It, erm... <A
              HREF="http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-5326.html" target="_self">didn't go down to well at first...&nbsp;</A> Still it
              was something. And I felt it was the right thing to do, and I still do.</B>
              <P><B>Things carried on, me and Locke_gb7 would talk for hours while spriting, I would submit a sheet to
              tSR every now and again (with a nice big RetroGameZone tag in it for advertising) and the world kept
              spinning. I moved to York, loosing my internet (I managed to sponge from a neighbour's insecure network
              occasionally) which slowed things down but I was still spriting, and still talking to Locke_gb7. And then
              around the 9th September 2012 - I got a job. A job, and a &quot;outside the internet&quot; social life. I
              still kept at it for a while but it was becoming more and more clear that I didn't have time for it. As
              much as I loved spriting it was in essence, a job. I still had my relaxation time of watching TV, playing
              videogames, reading etc. - and it was just impossible to find time for it between that and work. It was
              the end of my carefree life as a jobless man who lived online.</B></P>
              <P><B>I still love videogames. I still love sprites, and I love this site so so much. I spent years
              creating it, it is truly precious to me. I hope one day to start spriting again, to see more of my work on
              tSR. To finish ripping DarkStalkers, and showing more of the amazing sprites from the Metal Slug series.
              Those 2D pixel pieces of art are just so, so beautiful. So, I'll still be around. Probably on the
              VG-Resource Forums (what the tSR forums have become) moaning about Nintendo and giving bad life advice.
              And if any of you old Captain N Forum people are still around - shoot me an email, I would love to hear
              from all of you.</B>

              but well here's another one.</I></FONT></B>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>Anyone who's been even slightly following my life knows things went, well,
              pretty bad. In one way it's amazing to see how strong the human soul is, on another it's nearly impossible
              to even conceive how hard a person can fall and just how cruel people can seem to be - and your brain
              nearly ripping itself apart to try and understand the logic.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>I've made mistakes, I've handled things badly at times, but I feel I'm in a
              good place again. I'm not a perfect person, my morals aren't golden - but they are a part of me. I can't
              chisel myself into a perfect image and I've accepted I'm not going to be the 'self' I was before all this,
              things have changed.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>And well, I miss you guys, I've distanced myself from a lot of people, a
              self created void, ignoring the help offered and excluding many of the people who mean the most to me. I
              miss Dazz. Finally had the pleasure of meeting him and his wife not too long ago (well, probably a while
              ago now) and I have to say I was nervous. Not because he's famous or any of that nonsense (hey man, you
              was just a kid when I got started Wink ) but it's always weird when you first meet someone you've known
              online for so long. But it was great, it was just him, as I knew him, and we talked as if we'd met in the
              pub every weekend.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>I've tried ripping sprites again, and well, I just don't think it's going
              to happen. I just don't have the time. After work it's just not what I want to do now. During the
              education/unemployment years it was fine, it was kinda like work, sure I enjoyed it but I no longer have
              time for it and my hobbies or just relaxing time. I hope during a week off or something I'll get some time
              to get DarkStalkers finished but well, even that's up in the air.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>Which brings me onto the other news. I haven't touched my website since the
              9/9/12 - that's more than 2 years. Yeah I know I wasn't the biggest, the best, hell some of my sheets have
              been far eclipsed by others now. But they mean a lot to me. I generally get nostalgic and happy just
              looking at them because I remember the work that went into them, the excitement of finishing them, and the
              joy of seeing them online. Working together with my good friend Locke_gb7 of Nes-Snes-Sprites just filled
              so many years of great times, I just have so many good memories, so many laughs. It's been a pleasure, a
              real pleasure.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>From seeing Dazz as a troubled kid with some serious demons, to becoming
              pretty much &quot;the&quot; sprite guy was something great to be apart of, great to witness. No it may not
              mean a lot to many, thousands won't know where that Metal Slug sprite in RetroGamer UK came from, 100s
              won't know who ripped the sprites for that stupid Flash animation of &quot;Link, He goes to Town&quot; -
              but we were there, offering a surface, playing with tools and pouring in hours of our lives just to
              archive the graphics of the game we enjoyed so much, for others to use or for simply viewing pleasure so
              people can appreciate them. You never appreciate a waterfall until you can hear it, and you can never
              appreciate a sprite fully until you've seen it frame by frame.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>So yeah, I'll miss it. But it's time to hang it up. Dazz, it's yours. All
              the content that says &quot;Ripped by Goemar&quot; at the bottom of the page is yours for tSR. I won't be
              renewing my hosting. I started this thing on the 1st January 2003. It was never a business, I never wanted
              to expand it. It was just my thing. Well, mine and Locke_gb7's thing - we were two best friends just
              loving what we did. It was like our own personal clubhouse.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>I'm sorry about the long post, for those who don't get excited by the fact
              that when punching someone close as oppose to further away has 5 different frames of animation - a lot of
              this probably means very little. But I'm back. No doubt everyone has changed there usernames (again) but
              well, I'm sure I'll get everyone placed eventually.</I></FONT></B></P>
              <P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I>I used to love having this place as part of my life, I hope to do that
              again.</I></FONT></B></P>
